You will have 20 seconds for every question if you fail to answer within the given time you will be alerted that you have gotten the answer wrong and failed to answer it. Once every question has been answered or failed to answer you will be able to see your reults. If you happen to be a motivated soul who seeks to answer each question correctly or improve your score you can press the restart quiz button that will restart the quiz for you.
